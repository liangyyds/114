Hey guys,I am a humorous and outgoing person, you guys can also call me baba. My hobby is reading. Because I like to learn more knowledge and I enjoy the moment when Iâ€™m alone.So I usually read some books before I go to sleep. My dream is to travel all around the world. I plan to do this over the next 30 years. I have always loved meeting new people and learning about new cultures.
